[Tab - Intro]

[Primeira Parte]

<b>F#m</b>
    She was more like a beauty queen

From a movie scene

I said don't mind
                               <b>Bm</b>
But what do you mean: I am the one

Who will dance on the floor
        <b>F#m</b>
In the round
                  <b>Bm</b>
She said I am the one

Who will dance on the floor
        <b>F#m</b>
In the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean

As she caused a scene

Then every head turned with eyes that
                     <b>Bm</b>
Dreamed of being the one

Who will dance on the floor

In the round

[Pré-Refrão]

 <b>D9</b>
People always told me:
    <b>F#m7(11)</b>
Be careful of what you do
           <b>D9</b>
And don't go around
                       <b>F#m7(11)</b>
Breaking young girl's hearts
    <b>D9</b>
My mother always told me:
    <b>F#m7(11)</b>
Be careful of who you love
        <b>D9</b>
And be careful of what you do
            <b>C#7</b>
'Cause the lie becomes the truth

[Refrão]

<b>F#m</b> (Frase 1)
    Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl
                         <b>Bm</b> (Frase 2)
Who claims that I am the one
                       <b>F#m</b>
But the kid is not my son
                  <b>Bm</b> (Frase 2)
She says I am the one
                       <b>F#m</b>
But the kid is not my son

[Segunda Parte]

<b>F#m</b>
    For forty days and forty nights

The law was on her side

But who can stand when she's in demand
                  <b>Bm</b>
Her schemes and plans

'Cause we danced on the floor
        <b>F#m</b>
In the round
                     <b>Bm</b>
So take my strong advice
                                <b>F#m</b>
Just remember to always think twice

(Do think twice, do think twice)

She told: My baby

We danced 'til three

Then she looked at me

Then showed a photo my baby cried
                    <b>Bm</b>
His eyes were like mine
</pre><pre class="col2">'Cause we danced on the floor
        <b>F#m</b>
In the round, baby

[Pré-Refrão]

 <b>D9</b>
People always told me
    <b>F#m7(11)</b>
Be careful of what you do
           <b>D9</b>
And don't go around
                       <b>F#m7(11)</b>
Breaking young girl's hearts

         <b>D9</b>
But she came and stood right by me
          <b>F#m7(11)</b>
Just to smell her sweet perfume
      <b>D9</b>
This happened much too soon
     <b>C#7</b>
She called me to her room

[Refrão Final]

<b>F#m</b> (Frase 1)
    Billie Jean is not my lover

She's just a girl
                         <b>Bm</b> (Frase 2)

She says he is my son

(Breaking my heart, babe)

She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

Billie Jean is not my lover

(Call me, Billie Jean)

Billie Jean is not my lover

(She is not at the scene)

Billie Jean is not my lover
