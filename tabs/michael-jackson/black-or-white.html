(intro - riff 8x)

<b>E</b>
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and
 the same
     <b>A</b>
Now I believe in miracles
                                   (riff)
and a miracle has happened tonight
<b>B</b>
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
          <b>A</b>                            <b>E</b>
it don't matter if you're black or white

(riff 4x)

<b>E</b>
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them, I ain't second to none
    <b>A</b>
And I told about equality
                                             
      (riff)
and it's true, either you're wrong or you're 
right
<b>B</b>
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
          <b>A</b>                            <b>E</b>
it don't matter if you're black or white

(riff 8x)

<b>E</b>                                          
I`m tired of this devil, I`m tired of this 
     <b>G</b> <b>A</b>
stuff
I`m tired of this business, so when the going
           <b>G</b> <b>A</b>
 gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother, I ain't 
                   <b>G</b> <b>A</b>
scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody, girl when the goin'
          <b>G</b> <b>A</b>
 gets mean
</pre><pre class="col2">(ponte)

                      <b>Em</b>          <b>A</b>
Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
         <b>Em</b>               <b>A</b>
causing grief in human relations
<b>Em</b>                         <b>A</b>
It's a turf war on a global scale
<b>Em</b>                                <b>A</b>
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
          <b>Em</b>                    <b>A</b>       <b>Em</b>
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
                 <b>A</b>                        
Where your blood comes from is where your 
<b>Em</b>
space is
                         <b>A</b>
I've seen the bright get duller
<b>A</b>
I'm not going to spend my life being a color

       <b>A</b>
Don't tell me you agree with me,
                                    <b>E</b>  (riff)
when I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
<b>B</b>
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
         <b>A</b>                               <b>E</b> 
it don't matter if you're black or white
(riff)

  <b>B</b>
I said, if you're thinkin' about my baby
             <b>A</b>                               
it don't matter if you're black or white
<b>E</b> (riff)

  <b>B</b>
I said, if you're thinkin' of being my 
brother
         <b>A</b>                               <b>E</b> 
it don't matter if you're black or white
