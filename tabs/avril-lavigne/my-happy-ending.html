<b>Bm</b>     <b>G</b>      <b>D</b>      <b>A/C#</b>
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...
<b>Bm</b>     <b>G</b>      <b>D</b>      <b>A</b>
oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

                <b>Bm</b>
Let's talk this over
                     <b>G7+</b>
It's not like we're dead
                    <b>Dsus2</b>
Was it something I did?
         <b>D</b>            <b>Asus</b>
Was it something You said?
 <b>A</b>                   <b>Bm</b>
Don't leave me hanging
                <b>G7+</b>
In a city so dead
               <b>Dsus2</b>
held up so high
          <b>D</b>              <b>Asus</b>
On such a breakable thread

<b>A</b>          <b>G7+</b>                <b>A</b>
You were all the things I thought I knew
    <b>G7+</b>                   <b>A</b>
And I thought we could be

(Distorção)
              <b>Gsus2</b>          <b>D</b>          <b>A</b>
You were everything, everything that I wanted
              <b>Gsus2</b>          <b>D</b>              
We were meant to be, supposed to be, but we 
 <b>A</b>
lost it
             <b>Gsus2</b>          <b>D</b>             
ALL of the memories, so close to me, just 
 <b>A</b>    <b>Bm</b>
fade away

<b>Em</b>                            <b>D/F#</b>
All this time you were pretending
<b>G</b>
So much for my happy ending

(Riff)

oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh...

                <b>Bm</b>
You've got your dumb friends
                 <b>G7+</b>
I know what they say
                   <b>Dsus2</b>    <b>D</b>
They tell you I'm difficult
            <b>Asus</b>  <b>A</b>
But so are they
                <b>Bm</b>
But they don't know me
              <b>G7+</b>
Do they even know you?
               <b>Dsus2</b>         <b>D</b>
All the things you hide from me
                      <b>Asus</b>
All the shit that you do

<b>A</b>          <b>G7+</b>                 <b>A</b>
You were all the things I thought I knew
    <b>G7+</b>              <b>A</b>
And I thought we could be

It's nice to know that you were there
                              <b>A</b>
Thanks for acting like you cared
                                   <b>G</b>
And making me feel like I was the only one
<b>A</b>                               <b>Bm</b>
It's nice to know we had it all
                              <b>G7+</b>
Thanks for watching as I fall
                             <b>A</b>
And letting me know we were done

        <b>Gsus2</b>          <b>D</b>          <b>A</b>
He was everything, everything that I wanted
