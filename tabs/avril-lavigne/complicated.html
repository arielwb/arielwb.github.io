             <b>Dm</b>  <b>A#9</b> <b>F</b>  <b>C</b>

[Primeira Parte]

<b>F</b>
  Chill out what you're yelling for?
<b>Dm</b>
   Lay back, it's all been done before
<b>A#9</b>
   And if you could only
 <b>C</b>
Let it be, you will see
<b>F</b>
  I like you the way you are
<b>Dm</b>
   When we're drivin' in your car
<b>A#9</b>
   And you're talking to me
<b>C</b>
One on one, but you become

[Pré-Refrão]

 <b>A#9</b>
Somebody else, round everyone else
        <b>Dm</b>
You're watching your back

Like you can't relax
         <b>A#9</b>
You're tryin' to be cool
                         <b>C</b>
You look like a fool to me, tell me

[Refrão]

  <b>Dm</b>
Why do you have to go and make
  <b>A#9</b>            <b>F</b>
Things so complicated?
   <b>C</b>
I see the way you're
<b>Dm</b>                          <b>A#9</b>
Acting like you're somebody else
              <b>F</b>
Gets me frustrated
   <b>C</b>
A life's like this you

<b>Dm</b>                     <b>A#9</b>
   You fall, and you crawl
                        <b>F</b>
And you break, and you take
                       <b>C</b>
What you get, and you turn it into
 <b>Gm</b>
Honesty, promise me I'm never
                <b>A#9</b>            <b>F</b>
Gonna find you fake it, no no no

[Segunda Parte]

You come over unannounced
<b>Dm</b>
   Dressed up like you're somethin' else
<b>A#9</b>
   Where you are and where it's
<b>C</b>
At you see, you're making me
<b>F</b>
  Laugh out when you strike your pose
<b>Dm</b>
   Take off all your preppy clothes
<b>A#9</b>
   You know you're not fooling
<b>C</b>
Anyone, when you become
