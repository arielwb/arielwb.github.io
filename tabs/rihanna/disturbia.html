What's wrong with me?
Why do I feel like this?
I'm going crazy now

<b>Bm</b>      <b>D</b>          <b>A</b>
No more gas in the rig
           <b>G</b>
Can't even get it started
<b>Bm</b>      <b>D</b>               <b>A</b>
Nothing heard, nothing said
           <b>G</b>
Can't even speak about it
<b>Bm</b>      <b>D</b>           <b>A</b>
All my life on my head
           <b>G</b>
Don't want to think about it
<b>Bm</b>      <b>D</b>           <b>A</b>
Feels like I'm going insane
   <b>G</b>
Ye-ah

<b>Bm</b>       <b>D</b>          <b>A</b>
It's a thief in the night
           <b>G</b>
To come and grab you
<b>Bm</b>       <b>D</b>           <b>A</b>
It can creep up inside you
       <b>G</b>
And consume you
<b>Bm</b>     <b>D</b>          <b>A</b>
A disease of the mind
       <b>G</b>
It can control you
<b>Bm</b>       <b>D</b>        <b>A</b>       <b>G</b>
It's too close for comfort

Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must faulter be wise
Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
Disturbia
Am I scaring you tonight
Your mind is in disturbia
Ain't used to what you like
Disturbia
Disturbia

It's like they talkin' to me
Disconnectin' your call
Your phone don't even ring
I gotta get out
Or figure this shit out
It's too close for comfort

It's a thief in the night
To come and grab you
It can creep up inside you
And consume you
A disease of the mind
It can control you
I feel like a monster

Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must faulter be wise
Your mind is in disturbia

Release me from this curse
I've been trying to maintain
But I'm struggling
You can't go, go, go
I think I'm going to oh, oh, oh

Throw on your break lights
We're in the city of wonder
Ain't gonna play nice
Watch out, you might just go under
Better think twice
Your train of thought will be altered
So if you must faulter be wise
Your mind is in disturbia
It's like the darkness is the light
