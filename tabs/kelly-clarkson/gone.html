Letra:

What you see is not what you get!
With you, there's just no measurement!
No way to tell what's real from what isn't...
 there!

Your eyes, they sparkled..
That's all changed into lies that drop like 
acid rain...
You washed away the best of me!
You don't care...

Refrão:
You know you did it!
I'm gone!!!
To find someone to live for in this world...</pre><pre class="col2">There's no light at the end of the tunnel 
tonight,
Just a bridge that I gotta burn!
You are wrong!!!
If you think you can walk right through my 
door.
That is just so you, coming back when I've 
finally moved... on!
I'm already gone!!!

Sometimes shattered, never open!
Nothing matters when you're broken...
That was me, whenever I was with... you!
Always ending!
Always over!
Back and Forth, Up and Down, Like a roller 
coaster...
I am breaking... that habit... today!

(Refrão)

There is nothing you can say... Sorry doesn't
 cut it, babe!
Take the hit and walk away... Cause I'm gone!
Doesn't matter what you do!
It's what you did that's hurting you...
All I needed was the truth... Now I'm gone!

What you see is not what you get...
What you see is not what you get...

(Refrão)

I'm already Gone!!!
I'm already gone...
Already Gone!

I'm gone...
