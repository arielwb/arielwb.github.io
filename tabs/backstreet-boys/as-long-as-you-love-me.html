[Primeira Parte]

          <b>Am</b>                            <b>F</b>
Although loneliness has always been a friend 
of mine
     <b>G</b>                       <b>C</b>    <b>G/B</b>
I'm leaving my life in your hands
 <b>Am</b>                           <b>F</b>
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
 <b>G</b>                    <b>C</b>    <b>G/B</b>
Risking it all in a glance
 <b>Am</b>                              <b>F</b>
How you got me blind is still a mystery
   <b>G</b>                       <b>C</b>   <b>G/B</b>
I can't get you out of my head
 <b>Am</b>                                 <b>F</b>
Don't care what is written in your history
    <b>G</b>                        <b>C</b>
As long as you're here with me

[Refrão]

               <b>F</b>            <b>C</b>
I don't care who you are, where you're from
  <b>Am</b>              <b>G4</b>          <b>G</b>
What you did, as long as you love me
  <b>F</b>            <b>C</b>
Who you are, where you're from
               <b>Am</b>           <b>G4</b>          <b>G</b>
Don't care what you did as long as you love 
me

[Segunda Parte]

<b>Am</b>                                <b>F</b>
Every little thing that you have said and 
done
 <b>G</b>                           <b>C</b>   <b>G/B</b>
Feels like it's deep within me
 <b>Am</b>                             <b>F</b>
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
    <b>G</b>                        <b>C</b>
It seems like we're meant to be

[Refrão]

I don't care who you are, where you're from

Don't care what you did as long as you love

me

( <b>F</b>  <b>C</b>  <b>Am</b>  <b>G4</b>  <b>G</b> )

[Ponte]

<b>Am</b>                          <b>C/G</b>
  I try to hide it so that no one knows
       <b>F</b>                              <b>G</b>    
But I guess it shows when you look into my 
    <b>Am</b>
eyes
                               <b>C/G</b>           
What you did and where you're coming from (I 
       <b>F#m7/5-</b>
don't care)
    <b>F7+</b>         <b>G</b>          <b>F</b>
As long as you love me, baby

        <b>C</b>                   <b>F</b>
Who you are, where you're from (where you're 
from)

As long as you love me
