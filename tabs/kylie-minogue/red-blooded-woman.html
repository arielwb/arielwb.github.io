Count backwards 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Before you get too heated and turned on (this
 guy)
You should've learned your lessons all them 
times before
You've been bruised, you've been broken
And theres my mind saying think before you go
Through that door it could lead to nowhere 
(this guy)
Has got you all romantic crazy in your head
Do you think I listen, no I don't care

<b>Gm</b>  <b>Cm</b>  <b>D</b>   <b>Gm</b>

Cause I can't focus I can't stop
You got me spinning round, round, round, 
round (like a record)
Careful, 'cause it's too hot (inside)
       <b>D</b>
You'll never get to Heaven, if your scared of
 getting high

<b>Gm</b>  <b>Cm</b>  <b>D</b>   <b>Gm</b>

(Boy, boy) Let me keep freaking around, I 
wanna get down
I'm a red-blooded woman, what's the point of 
hanging around?
(Boy, boy)
Don't wanna keep turning it down, when this 
girl wants to rock with you,
(Boy, boy)
Let me keep freaking around, I wanna get down
I'm a red-blooded woman, what's the point of 
hanging around?

My conscious saying, get down off this dream
It's too dangerous and deadly (this guy)
Has got you talking around and circles can't 
you see,
All for the sake of sexy (lovin it)
Then there's my sense saying stop before you 
fall
I dont wanna pick you up again (this guy)
Has got you all romantic, crazier each day
Do you think I listen, there's no way
