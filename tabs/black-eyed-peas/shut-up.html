[Chorus]
<b>Dm</b>
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin' control
And we try to make it work
         <b>Bb</b>
But it still isn't the worst
          <b>Gm</b>
And I'm craaazzzy
                      <b>A</b>
For tryin to be your laaadddy
I think I'm goin' crazy

<b>Dm</b>
Girl, me and you were just fine (you know)
We wine and dine
Did them things that couples do when in love 
(you know)
<b>Bb</b>
Walks on the beach and stuff (you know)
  <b>Gm</b>
Things that lovers say and do
I love you boo, I love you too
              <b>A</b>
I miss you a lot, I miss you even more
That's why I flew you out
When we was on tour
          <b>Dm</b>
But then something got out of hand
You start yellin' when I'm with my friends
Even though I had legitimate reasons (bull 
shit)
     <b>Bb</b>
You know I have to make them evidence (bull 
shit)
<b>Gm</b>
How could you trust our private lives girl
That's why you don't believe my lies
               <b>A</b>
And quit this lecture Shut up  just shut up

And I'm craaazzzy
                      <b>A</b>
For tryin to be your laaadddy
I think I'm goin' crazy

<b>Dm</b>
Why does he know she gotta move so fast
Love is progress if you could make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
<b>Bb</b>
Every time you agree on takin it slow
    <b>Gm</b>
So why does it got to be so damn tough
Cuz fools in lust could never get enough of 
love
                <b>A</b>
Showin him the love that you be givin
Changing up your livin' for a lovin' 
transistion
(<b>A</b>)-<b>Dm</b>
     Girl lip so much she tryin to get you to
 listen
Few mad at each other has become our 
tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
