Introdução

<b>Em</b>
I didn't hear what you were saying
<b>Em</b>
I live on raw emotion baby
<b>Am</b>                              <b>Bm</b>
I answer questions, never maybe
<b>Em</b>
And I'm not kind if you betray me
<b>Em</b>
So who the hell are you to save me?
<b>Am</b>                            <b>Bm</b>
I never would've made it baby
 <b>Em</b>
If you needed love  Well then ask for love
Could have given love Now I'm taking love
     <b>B</b>
And it's not my fault Coz you both deserve
What's coming now So don't say a word

Refrão

    <b>Em</b>

another man in my bed
            <b>B</b>

me?  I don't think so
<b>Em</b>

 to shoot him dead
         <b>B</b>

around here?

<b>Em</b>                              <b>Bm</b>  <b>Em</b>
