[Verse 1]

<b>D</b>                              <b>D/F#</b>
  No matter what you say about love
                       <b>Bm</b>
I keep coming back for more

Keep my hand in the fire
<b>G</b>                                     <b>D</b>
Sooner or later I get what I’m asking for

<b>D</b>                              <b>D/F#</b>
  No matter what you say about life,
                      <b>Bm</b>
I learn every time I bleed.

The truth is a stranger
   <b>G</b>
My soul is in danger,
                          <b>A</b>
I gotta let my spirit be free to,
                                <b>G</b>
Admit that I was wrong and then change my 
mind.
<b>A</b>                                     <b>G</b> 
Sorry but I have to move on and leave you 
      <b>G/A</b> <b>A</b>
behind.

[Chorus]

<b>D</b>                                   <b>A</b>
I can’t waste time so give me the moment
                          <b>Bm</b>
I realize nothing’s broken

No need to worry about everything I’ve done
<b>G</b>
  Live every second like it was my last one
<b>D</b>                                   <b>A</b>
Don’t look back got a new direction
                                    <b>Bm</b>
I loved you once needed protection

You’re still a part of everything I do
<b>G</b>                                       <b>D</b>
  You’re on my heart just like a tattoo
                   <b>D/F#</b>
Just like a tattoo,
                     <b>Bm</b>
I’ll always have you
                     <b>G</b>
I'll always have you

[Verse 2]

<b>D</b>                                    <b>D/F#</b>
I'm sick of playing all of these games
                            <b>Bm</b>
It's not about taking ties.

When I look in the mirror,
<b>G</b>
Didn't deliver
                               <b>A</b>
It hurt enough to think that I could stop
                              <b>G</b>
Admit that I'm wrong and then change my mind.
<b>A</b>                                     <b>G</b> 
Sorry but I gotta be strong and leave you 
       <b>G/A</b> <b>A</b>
behind

[Chorus]

<b>D</b>                                   <b>A</b>
I can’t waste time so give me the moment
                          <b>Bm</b>
I realize nothing’s broken

I'll always have you

[Bridge]

<b>Em</b>                     <b>G</b>
If I live every moment
                        <b>Bm</b>
Won't change any moment
                       <b>A</b>
Still a part of me and you.
<b>Em</b>                        <b>G</b>
I will never regret you
                        <b>Bm</b>
Still the memory of you
                   <b>F#sus4</b> <b>F#</b>
Marks everything I do.

[Chorus]
